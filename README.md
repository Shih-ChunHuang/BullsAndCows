# BullsAndCows

I first created this game using Python back in fall 2015. I was writing in scripting style. After I learned Java, I tried to wrtie the same game using Java. So, here it is!

The program will generate a 4-digit secret number, and the digits must be all different.
Then, the player guess the number. 
If the matching digits are in their right positions, they are "bulls", if in different positions, they are "cows."

In this game, I allow zero to be the first digit.
